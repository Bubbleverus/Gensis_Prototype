# Abstract
In this project my role was to create and work with:
#### Trading system;
#### Lootbox system;
#### Inventory system with enums;
#### Use items from inventory;
#### Weapon Stats UI;
#### Ability: Taunt;
In our game there are four characters with different abilities. I made taunt ability for character named Talos. On player hit ability button “E”,first it checks are there any AI enemies within distance of 600 meters and then gets their AI controller set their focus on our player, it also spawns a particle for effect that ability is used. AI then set his focus on Talos and as soon as that happens he finds location near our player and attack him. 
#### AI enemy and boss;
#### Add sounds to weapons;
#### Item structures;
#### Enums;
#### Physical Animation for AI;
#### Animation blueprints and blends for Boss and Enemy AI;
