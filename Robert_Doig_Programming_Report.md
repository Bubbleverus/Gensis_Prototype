# Brief 
The specification of this project was it had to meet the follow criteria. 
- Lan or Wan multipler. 
- Third Person Character. 


# Introduction
In the initial design meetings we had focused mainly on a CO-OP based game as that was the types of games played by the team.
We had chosen a massive scope with lots of different features and systems that we could impletement to make this survival type game.
We refined this into a more managable size. The overall workings off the group and the features that were cut will be explained in 
a later section. 

This game would take place in two different maps and would be a short mission to demonstate the type and game that we would be creating.
The old city was the characters main home and we had to survive and bring aid to those who needed it from the fallout of the Genesis AI 
who now controlled the world. Within the old would we would have a market place to trade your goods and upgrade your weapons. This would
also be the main place of receiving new missions from various characters. 

This report will cover the features that I personally implemented and how the project went over all from a programatic point of view. 
For all other features within this game please read the other reports by other programmers. Links will be provided below.   

# Features Implemented 

When we started the project we spilt up the three main problems that we had to overcome. These were Lan connectivity, Third person controls 
with accurate firing and an enemy AI. Leyla had started on the enemy AI, Louis the Third person controls and I started on the Lan. Thoughtout
the project we had weekly meetings which we would talk about what was happening within the project and to rearrange tasks to suit our team. 
Overall these features were relatively seperate from each other. Over the project these were the feature that I implementated. 

- Lan Connectivity
- Character Classes for each character inherited from a base character 
- Characters controls and weapon aiming and firing
- Characters Abilities main the base function
  - Eagle vision
  - Invisibility
